# RogueLikeGame

### Created by Leonid Belyi on 4/3/2017

A fun game designed in the style of the original "Rogue" game.
Used a starting template from YouTube user "MakingGamesWithBen"'s video 
"Game Challenge 3: ASCII Roguelike."

## How to Play

To test the game out for oneself, one should first download the ZIP file, then in the "RogueLikeGame" directory,
one should run the "RogueLikeGame.exe" file. This will bring up the ASCII Console-based game. 

The game starts out with a title screen and prompting the user for a response to choose a new game, load a game, or quit.
For the best results, use "new", "load", and "quit" for these options.
