		I was away more than my people thought that I should be, mostly wasting my gold 
	on whores and milk of the poppy. They weren't to happy so they stormed the castle and 
	me out. I lived in the woods near the castle waiting. The fool captain of the guard took	
	over my position as Lord. Let's just say that it didn't end well for him. But more on 
	that later.
									Sincerely, Lord Gaius
